## Scale factor applied

$$\sin(\alpha)^{\theta}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(x^i + \cos(f))$$
There are kinds of scale factors as a function of $\eta$ and $p_{T}$, including
- electron/muon/photon ID scale factor
- muon isolation scale factor
- electron reconstrution scale factor
- photon veto scale factor
- trigger scale factor
- pileup reweighting
- egamma energy scale and smearing
